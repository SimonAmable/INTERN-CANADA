## What is this?

This is an **open-source job site for internships in Canada**, meaning that others can hopefully contribute to the project and job listings, helping it grow into something greater. 

Currently, the app is in the **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** stage and is fully functional, collecting and displaying over **1,000 internships**! It currently supports **location search, Various filters, and keyword search** across job titles, companies, locations, and **descriptions** (the full descriptions are on the company's site, but I promise the search still works!). 

Upcoming features include:
- **More Filters**
- **Sorting Option**
- **Semantic AI search** (Really just depending on costs!!).

## Why did I make this?

**Great question!**

If you've used a university co-op site, you know why. They often contain outdated job listings, and in my experience, my school's job board was a table so large it didn't fit on any screen, with no search features and very limited jobs...

It was discouraging, to say the least, but it motivated me to create something better—**this job site!**

(Not to say university co-op programs aren't worth it, they absolutely are if you can afford them and once you secure a good job, They pay for themselves mmultiple times over!)

## TODO

- **Keep it lean:** Avoid adding unnecessary features. I like the minimalistic design approach, and the app is built to be clean and easy to maintain.
- **Add filters for other attributes:** Potential filters could include salary once the data layer is cleaned to ensure consistent salary information. Additional attributes can be added based on user requests.
- **Add a quick feature request button:** This could be a simple message form that helps gather feedback. I don't want users to have to visit another site to contact me.
- **Add "Sort by" functionality.**
