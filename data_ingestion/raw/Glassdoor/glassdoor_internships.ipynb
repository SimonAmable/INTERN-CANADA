This exact role may not be open today but could open in the near future. When you apply, a Cisco representative may contact you directly if a relevant position opens.\\nWho You’ll Work With\\nOur hardworking team members are busy programming magic across the globe on teams such as Engineering, Information Technology, Supply Chain, Customer Experience, Security and Trust, etc.\\nYou would play a crucial role in driving next-gen software innovations including cloud, mobile, desktop or security spaces. On any of these teams, you\\'ll get hands-on experience working with applications that make technology accessible no matter what device they’re on. See the possibilities when creativity meets design and build solutions which will transform how we work, live, learn, and play.\\nWhat You’ll Do\\nOur software engineers are the gurus behind the scenes, ensuring all of our programs are easy to use and bug free. Using a keen eye, you’ll develop software and tools in support of many of our high-impact technology platforms such as operating systems, networks, databases and more. While we’re growing in the software business, you’ll still need to see the big picture and watch for hardware compatibility while even potentially influencing design.\\nUnsure where to start? Apply and explore all of the possibilities in: Applications Development, Database Development, Embedded Networking and OS Development, IT, Security, Test & Quality, Web Services, etc.\\nWho You Are\\nA software developer who demonstrates exceptional communication and collaboration abilities, coupled with a genuine enthusiasm for tackling complex challenges. The ideal candidate will exhibit outstanding organizational skills and a keen aptitude for managing their time efficiently.\\nAs a process-driven individual, you will have a fervent desire to streamline and enhance existing procedures. Your adeptness in time management will empower you to effectively prioritize tasks and deliver high-quality work within set deadlines.\\nJoin our team and apply your passion for problem-solving to create innovative software solutions that make a difference.\\nMinimum Qualifications\\nIncluding but not limited to an upcoming graduate of a technical degree or certification program from a Technical Boot Camp, Apprenticeship, Community College or 4-Year University.\\nActively enrolled in an educational program in Computer Science, Software Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering or related field\\nUp-to-date on programming and scripting languages: C/C++, Python, and/or Java\\nHands on QA, Testing, and/or Debugging skills\\nAble to legally live and work in the country for which you’re applying and have an authorized internship with your school\\nPreferred Qualifications\\nKnowledge of Linux, Networking concepts, OS fundamentals, Embedded Development, and/or ML\\nExperience with Databases, Web Application Development, and Web Services\\nKnowledge in Computer Networking and/or Cybersecurity\\nKnowledge of Cloud Platforms: AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud\\nWhy Cisco\\n#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.\\nWe embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (40 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!\\nBut “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)\\nDay to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.\\nSo, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing?

Certains nous pensent peut-être « vieux » (40 ans de réussites!) et axés seulement sur le matériel, mais nous sommes également une entreprise de logiciels Et une entreprise axée sur la sécurité. Nous avons même inventé un réseau intuitif qui s’adapte, prédit, apprend et protège. Aucune autre entreprise ne peut faire ce que nous faisons; nous ne pouvons pas être enfermés dans une seule case!\\n\\nL’expression « transformation numérique » sert à attirer l’attention, mais elle est plutôt vide de sens si elle ne s’accompagne pas d’une culture qui autorise l’innovation, la créativité et, oui, même l’échec (si cela permet d’apprendre).\\n\\nAu quotidien, nous nous concentrons sur l’offre et la demande. Nous donnons le meilleur de nous-mêmes, nous mettons notre ego de côté, et nous mettons du cœur au travail (cela fait partie de notre ADN). Nous prenons nos responsabilités, nous prenons des mesures audacieuses, et nous savons apprécier la différence. Parce que sans diversité de pensée et sans engagement pour l’égalité entre tous, il n’y a pas de progrès.\\n\\nVous avez des cheveux colorés? Ce n’est pas important. Vous avez des tatouages?

It is not typical for the salary to be offered near the top of the range, and salary is dependent on numerous factors.

The total compensation package for regular full-time management roles includes pay-for-performance programs for annual and medium time periods. Maintaining a high-performance culture and excellence is a core expectation of every member of our leadership team and is rewarded through the established compensation framework.\\n\\nOPG is committed to employment equity.

This exact role may not be open today but could open in the near future. When you apply, a Cisco representative may contact you directly if a relevant position opens.\\nWho You’ll Work With\\nOur hardworking team members are busy programming magic across the globe on teams such as Engineering, Information Technology, Supply Chain, Customer Experience, Security and Trust, etc.\\nYou would play a crucial role in driving next-gen software innovations including cloud, mobile, desktop or security spaces. On any of these teams, you\\'ll get hands-on experience working with applications that make technology accessible no matter what device they’re on. See the possibilities when creativity meets design and build solutions which will transform how we work, live, learn, and play.\\nWhat You’ll Do\\nOur software engineers are the gurus behind the scenes, ensuring all of our programs are easy to use and bug free. Using a keen eye, you’ll develop software and tools in support of many of our high-impact technology platforms such as operating systems, networks, databases and more. While we’re growing in the software business, you’ll still need to see the big picture and watch for hardware compatibility while even potentially influencing design.\\nUnsure where to start? Apply and explore all of the possibilities in: Applications Development, Database Development, Embedded Networking and OS Development, IT, Security, Test & Quality, Web Services, etc.\\nWho You Are\\nA software developer who demonstrates exceptional communication and collaboration abilities, coupled with a genuine enthusiasm for tackling complex challenges. The ideal candidate will exhibit outstanding organizational skills and a keen aptitude for managing their time efficiently.\\nAs a process-driven individual, you will have a fervent desire to streamline and enhance existing procedures. Your adeptness in time management will empower you to effectively prioritize tasks and deliver high-quality work within set deadlines.\\nJoin our team and apply your passion for problem-solving to create innovative software solutions that make a difference.\\nMinimum Qualifications\\nIncluding but not limited to an upcoming graduate of a technical degree or certification program from a Technical Boot Camp, Apprenticeship, Community College or 4-Year University.\\nActively enrolled in an educational program in Computer Science, Software Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering or related field\\nUp-to-date on programming and scripting languages: C/C++, Python, and/or Java\\nHands on QA, Testing, and/or Debugging skills\\nAble to legally live and work in the country for which you’re applying and have an authorized internship with your school\\nPreferred Qualifications\\nKnowledge of Linux, Networking concepts, OS fundamentals, Embedded Development, and/or ML\\nExperience with Databases, Web Application Development, and Web Services\\nKnowledge in Computer Networking and/or Cybersecurity\\nKnowledge of Cloud Platforms: AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud\\nWhy Cisco\\n#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.\\nWe embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (40 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!\\nBut “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)\\nDay to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.\\nSo, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!\\nIngénieur logiciel (stagiaire) Canada\\n\\nLes candidatures sont acceptées jusqu’à nouvel ordre.\\n\\nVeuillez noter que cet affichage vise à annoncer des possibilités d’emploi potentielles.

Certains nous pensent peut-être « vieux » (40 ans de réussites!) et axés seulement sur le matériel, mais nous sommes également une entreprise de logiciels Et une entreprise axée sur la sécurité. Nous avons même inventé un réseau intuitif qui s’adapte, prédit, apprend et protège. Aucune autre entreprise ne peut faire ce que nous faisons; nous ne pouvons pas être enfermés dans une seule case!\\n\\nL’expression « transformation numérique » sert à attirer l’attention, mais elle est plutôt vide de sens si elle ne s’accompagne pas d’une culture qui autorise l’innovation, la créativité et, oui, même l’échec (si cela permet d’apprendre).\\n\\nAu quotidien, nous nous concentrons sur l’offre et la demande. Nous donnons le meilleur de nous-mêmes, nous mettons notre ego de côté, et nous mettons du cœur au travail (cela fait partie de notre ADN). Nous prenons nos responsabilités, nous prenons des mesures audacieuses, et nous savons apprécier la différence. Parce que sans diversité de pensée et sans engagement pour l’égalité entre tous, il n’y a pas de progrès.\\n\\nVous avez des cheveux colorés? Ce n’est pas important. Vous avez des tatouages? N’hésitez pas à les montrer. Vous aimez les vêtements à pois? C’est super! Vous êtes adepte de culture pop? Beaucoup d’entre nous le sont aussi.

For some teams, that will happen a couple of days a week, while for others, it could be coming together once a month. But the purpose of coming into the office should be exactly that — purposeful. \\nRethinking space utilization, developing sustainable and regenerative products, and designing energy-efficient and carbon-reducing buildings are all on the table as we transform how we work.
